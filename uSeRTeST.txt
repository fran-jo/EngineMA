- Script for importing data importData
* User provides reference file, and data is stored into internal database format, .h5
** User is allow to choose which data to import

- Script for data validation validationData.py
* Validation is applied to reference signals vs simulation signals, being reference signals from 
either other simulation tools or measurements
** The script allows the user to choose between sources (but the user must know the sources, since 
user provide the reference and simulation files)

Inputs for Mode Estimation
./res/meas/File_8.csv
./res/dymola/IEEENetworks2.IEEE_9Bus.h5

Inputs for ERA Method
./res/meas/PMUdata_Bus1VA2VALoad9PQ.csv
./res/openmodelica/PMUdata_Bus1VA2VALoad9PQ.h5

Inputs for Statistical Analysis
./res/psse/out_9bus_2.out
./res/dymola/IEEENetworks2.IEEE_9Bus.h5


Model resources for ERA test 
	PMUdata_Bus1VA2VALoad9PQ.csv, this file or relevant CSV file can be access for ERA
	
Requirements for Mode Estimation algorithm:
	mes.jar file is included in ROOT_PROJECT/lib, this folder is added to the classpath of the project
		(for testing, passing as input to the script
		
	mode_est_basic_fcn.m should be located under ROOT_PROJECT/res (if it dosen't work sometimes matlab 
		needs to set the matlab working directory)
