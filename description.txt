Hej,

modelres for ERA 
Requirements:
Only "PMUdata_Bus1VA2VALoad9PQ.csv" this file or relevent CSV file can be access for ERA

Mode Estiamtion
Requirements:
mes jar file needs to put in the scr/scripts 
matlab function for mode estiamtion needs to put in the same scr/scripts "mode_est_basic_fcn.m"(if it dosen't work sometimes matlab 
needs to set the matlab working directory)
I use a text file name "file" found in the same dorpbox sharedd folder 
this file.text is the matlab command "data = h5read('PMUdata_Bus1VA2VALoad9PQ.h5','/df/block0_values');" that is send from the Java jar 
send to matlab through using matlabcontrol 
This txt file also need to put in the same scr/scripts place where Java jar file is.

//
Cheers!
Enam
